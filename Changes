Revision history for Net-CouchDb

0.04 - No longer maintained

   Fix a few simple bugs anyway, but I no longer use this. Let me know if you'd
   like maint., but really I'd recommend you use CouchDB::Client instead.

   (I hate rt.cpan.org -- I didn't get an email about these bugs.)

   Fixed:
   - RT #49761: Missing dependency on Data::Dump
   - RT #44804: POSTing a Document without setting an id fails (maybe same
     issue as RT #44805, not sure)
   - RT #46647: dies when call() is called in list context
