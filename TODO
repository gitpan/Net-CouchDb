 * Should Document->new() really have the ID as the first parameter?
   Why not just as part of the data?  Maybe just make it prettier to
   create a document without an id (for posting).

 * Better support for creating and using views

 * Make errors get stuffed into an internal data structure accessible
   with $cdb->err / $cdb->errstr or some such

 * Make sure all methods return false on failure

 * Test test coverage with Devel::Cover

 * Make it easier (or default?) to have a ConnCache
